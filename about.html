	<p>Thomas Spencer Monson (born August 21, 1927) is an American religious leader, author, and <br>
	the sixteenth and current President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).</p>
	<p>As president, he is considered by adherents of the religion to be a "prophet, seer, and revelator." </p>
	<p>A printer by trade, he has spent most of his life engaged in various church leadership positions and public service.<br>
	Monson was ordained an LDS apostle at age 36, served in the First Presidency under three church presidents <br>
	and was the President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles from March 12, 1995, until he became President of <br>
	the Church on February 3, 2008. He succeeded Gordon B. Hinckley as church president.</p>
	<p>Monson has received four honorary doctorate degrees, as well as the Boy Scouts of America's Silver Buffalo <br>
	and the World Organization of the Scout Movement's Bronze Wolf—both awards are the highest awards in each organization. <br>
	He is a member of the National Executive Board of the Boy Scouts of America, the organization's governing body.<br>
	Monson is chairman of the Boards of Trustees/Education of the Church Educational System, and Ronald Reagan appointed <br>
	him to the U.S. President's Task Force for Private Sector Initiatives. He married Frances Beverly Monson (née Johnson) <br>
	in the Salt Lake Temple in 1948, and together they raised their three children. Frances died on May 17, 2013.</p>
	<p>On May 23, 2017, the LDS Church said Monson would no longer be attending meetings at the church's offices on a regular <br>
	basis, because of limitations incident to age.</p>
